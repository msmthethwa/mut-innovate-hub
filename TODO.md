# Invigilation Access Update - TODO List

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Update Invigilations.tsx filtering logic to allow staff and interns to view assigned invigilations
- [x] Add "Invigilation Duties" quick action for interns in Dashboard.tsx
- [x] Verify permission restrictions are maintained (staff/interns can only view, not edit/assign)

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Test the changes to ensure staff and interns can see their assigned invigilations
- [ ] Verify that permission restrictions are maintained (no edit/assign buttons for staff/interns)
- [ ] Test navigation from intern dashboard to invigilations page

## Summary of Changes
- Modified `filteredInvigilations` in Invigilations.tsx to include condition for staff/intern roles checking `assignedInvigilators` array
- Added invigilation quick action to intern dashboard in Dashboard.tsx
- Existing permission checks ensure staff/interns cannot perform admin/coordinator actions
